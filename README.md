# Students-Supporting-Critical-Care

Here, we, the Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zürich, provide access to our continuously developing 
training resources for the project "Students Supporting Critical Care during the COVID-19 epidemics".

This GitHub repository consists of two separate branches; (1) one containing the original training resources in German (with
some exceptions in English) and (2) the second containing all material in a translated form to English.

Please beware that most Resources have not been still uploaded, this will happen in the course of the next days.
